          This map shows the percentage of adults with a BMI of 30 or higher in
          2023. Unfortunately, not all countries are included in this analysis
          due to missing data, such as Antarctica.
          <strong>High obesity rates</strong> stand out clearly in North America
          (the United States and Mexico) and parts of the Middle East and North
          Africa (like Saudi Arabia and Egypt). These regions appear in darker
          orange-brown shades, indicating obesity rates above 30 to 40%.

        <p class="eda">
          Sugar can be an amending tool to help with lowering an individual's
          obesity. With the limited data available in terms of countries, it's
          suggested that for the most part, countries that engage in a lower
          average sugar consumption (kg per capita) have lower obesity rates.
          However, this is a weak association, and high-obesity countries appear
          despite relatively modest sugar intake.

          This line chart shows how the average BMI in Australia has changed
          over time for males, females, and the population overall. The steady
          upward trend across all groups highlights the gradual increase in
          average BMI, reflecting changes in lifestyle and dietary habits over
          the years.
