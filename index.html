          This map shows the percentage of adults with a BMI of 30 or higher in
          2023. Unfortunately, not all countries are included in this analysis
          due to missing data, such as Antarctica.
          <strong>High obesity rates</strong> stand out clearly in North America
          (the United States and Mexico) and parts of the Middle East and North
          Africa (like Saudi Arabia and Egypt). These regions appear in darker
          orange-brown shades, indicating obesity rates above 30 to 40%.

          Sugar can be an amending tool to help with lowering an individual's
          obesity. With the limied data avalaible in terms of countries, it's
          suggested that for the most part, couunties that engange in a lower
          average sugar consumption (kg per capita) that their obesity rates are
          lower. However, this is a weak association and high-obesity country
          appear despite relatively modest sugar intake.
