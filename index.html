      <h1 class="site-title">The Scarcity of Obesity</h1>

      <section class="page-intro">
        <p class="intro-text">
          Have you ever been unhappy about yourself when you looked in the
          mirror? Obesity could be one of the reasons why you think this way.
          Obesity is a growing global health challenge that affects millions of
          people and poses serious risks to long-term well-being. Defined by
          excessive body fat accumulation, it is often measured using the Body
          Mass Index (BMI), a simple calculation based on weight and height that
          helps categorize individuals into healthy, overweight, or obese
          ranges. However, obesity is more than just a number — it is shaped by
          a complex mix of lifestyle choices, dietary habits, physical activity
          levels, and more. This page explores these influences , offering a
          comprehensive look at how such a scarce issue has developed in
          Australia and worldwide, its health impacts and correlations, and the
          steps individuals and societies can take to prevent and manage it as a
          way forward.

        <div id="map" aria-label="Choropleth: global adult obesity rate"></div>
        <p class="eda">
          <strong>Obesity</strong> is a problem in the world including for
          Australians. This map shows the obesity rates -which has been
          population normalised - for adults with a BMI of 30 or higher in 2023.
          Unfortunately, not all countries are included in this analysis due to
          missing data, such as Antarctica.
          <strong>High obesity rates </strong>
          stand out clearly in North America (the United States and Mexico) and
          parts of the Middle East and North Africa (like Saudi Arabia and
          Egypt). Despite how Australia is not the worse, it suggestive that
          Australia should remain cautious to not over step itself.

          This really begs the question should Australia actually be scared of
          the issue of obesity? Despite Australia not being amongst the top
          worst countries for obesity, it's clear that that there is a steady
          upward trend across all groups highlighting the gradual increase in
          average BMI (Body Mass Index).

        ></div>
        <p class="eda">
          Multiple factors affect obesity in differing ways. Cutting back on
          sugar can be a powerful way to tackle obesity! Although data across
          countries is limited, the trend is clear with nations having lower
          average sugar consumption (kg per capita) tend to have lower obesity
          rates.

          Even the micro-habits practiced each day need to be addressed if there
          is a desire to avoid obesity. The implication is that individuals with
          Obesity Type I and Obesity Type III tend to spend two or more hours
          using technology. This has a similar effect on Obesity Type II, where
          the data show that the highest number of respondents were smokers.
          Despite high-calorie diets appearing to be the main micro-habit
          driving the majority of obesity cases, it can still be assumed that,
          in order to mitigate obesity, the other two habits could also be
          reduced at the individual level.

          To help reduce the risk of obesity, making mindful choices about sugar
          intake can be highly effective. Sugar itself doesn't need to be
          completely eliminated — instead, it should be managed wisely. In
          hindsight, fruits, vegetables and seafood may all seem 'healthy', but
          some are worst than others when combatting obesity. The visualisation
          shows the top 10 worst fruits, vegetables, and seafood options (from
          the avaliable data) ranked by their share of sugar calories. There are
          certianly many others that provide a wide range of healthier choices
          that can easily be incorporated into your diet every day.

        <h2 class="center">Obesity Rates vs. Physical activity</h2>
        <div id="physical" aria-label=""></div>
        <p class="eda">
          Taking care of your body through regular physical activity is
          essential. Just as reducing sugar consumption (measured in kilograms
          per capita) plays a key role, physical activity has emerged as one of
          the most influential factors in lowering obesity rates, as shown in
          the scatter plot. This relationship is highlighted by the contrast in
          the data: countries with the highest obesity rates tend to have a
          lower prevalence of sufficient physical activity, underscoring the
          importance of staying active.

          Be warned! Even if you are not concerned about obesity, there are many
          diseases that should make you think twice. The chart shows the top
          eight diseases linked to obesity across 2003, 2011, 2015, and 2018.
          The most significant among them accounts for an average of 3,105
          attributable deaths in Australia, highlighting the serious health
          risks associated with obesity and why it is crucial to take action to
          prevent such outcomes.
