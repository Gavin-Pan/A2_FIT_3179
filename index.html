          <p>
            Have you ever been unhappy about yourself when you looked in the
            mirror? <strong>Obesity</strong> could be one of the reasons why you
            think this way. Obesity is a
            <strong>growing global health challenge</strong> that affects
            millions of people and poses serious risks to long-term well-being.
            Defined by excessive body fat accumulation, it is often measured
            using the <strong>Body Mass Index (BMI)</strong>, a simple
            calculation based on weight and height that helps categorize
            individuals into healthy, overweight, or obese ranges.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, obesity is more than just a number — it is shaped by a
            complex mix of
            <strong
              >lifestyle choices, dietary habits, physical activity levels, and
              more</strong
            >. This page explores these influences, offering a comprehensive
            look at how such a scarce issue has developed in Australia and
            worldwide, its health impacts and correlations, and the steps
            individuals and societies can take to prevent and manage it as a way
            forward.

            <strong>Obesity</strong> is a problem in the world including for

            population-normalised — for adults with a BMI of 30 or higher in
            2023. Unfortunately, not all countries are included in this analysis

            <strong>Multiple factors</strong> affect obesity in differing ways.
            <strong> Sugar</strong> is suggested to be one of them. Although
            data across countries is limited, the trend is clear with nations
            having lower average sugar consumption (kg per capita) may tend to
            have lower obesity rates.

            consumption.
          </p>
          <p class="muted">
            Also, taking care of your body through regular
            <strong>physical activity</strong> is essential. Just as reducing
            sugar consumption (measured in kilograms per capita) plays a key
            role, physical activity has emerged as one of the most influential
            factors in lowering obesity rates, as shown in the scatter plot.
            This relationship is highlighted by the contrast in the data:
            <span style="color: #d8b4fe; font-weight: bold"
              >countries with the highest obesity rates</span
            >
            may tend to have a lower prevalence of sufficient physical activity,
            underscoring the importance of staying active.

            Even the <strong>micro-habits</strong> practiced each day need to be
